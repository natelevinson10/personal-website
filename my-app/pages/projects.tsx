By reverse engineering the Restful API framework of these retail websites, a backend multi-thread monitoring system is established using Python's Requests library to send an alert when an item matching given keywords (e.g. 'Air Jordan 1' or 'Wayne Gretzky' ) is loaded onto a website. This efficient monitoring process helps track product releases online and ensures timely attention to valuable opportunities leading to profit in the secondary market."]}
