This software monitors 60 websites that release products with high demand at retail prices which can be bought up and sold on secondary markets for substantial markups (sports cards, shoes, etc.). By reverse engineering the Restful API framework of these retail websites, a backend multi-thread monitoring system is established using Python's Requests library to send an alert when an item matching given keywords (e.g. 'Air Jordan 1' or 'Wayne Gretzky' ) is loaded onto a website. This efficient monitoring process helps track product releases online and ensures timely attention to valuable opportunities leading to profit in the secondary market."]}
